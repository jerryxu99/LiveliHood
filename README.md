# LiveliHood

LiveliHood is a web app designed to help those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complete daily tasks, such as shopping at a populated grocery store. This web app allows kind-hearted users to visualize tasks in their neighbourhood on a map and volunteer to help complete them.

### Stack

MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs

Other Tools:

- Google Maps API for visualization of tasks
- Axios and cors library for connecting to the backend
- Bootstrap, HTML, CSS for styling
- Jest and Supertest to automate testing in the backend
- Mongoose to manage the MongoDB database
- JWT to manage authentication middleware
- Bcrypt and Validator to hash passwords

Routes for the backend can be found in the backend folder's README

### TODO

- Sort tasks by status frontend
- More ways to sort tasks on the frontend
- Change logout/logoutall to a dropdown
